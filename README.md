## 🛠️ How to begin
At the very first step, clone this repository to your system and after that follow the below steps:
* Create a new file in the server folder where ```index.js``` file stored and name it as ```.env```. This is an environment variable file that holds some essential data.
  ```bash
  PORT=5500
  DB_URI_DEV=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/user-drive
  TOKEN_KEY=thisisasecrettokenkey
  ```
* Now install the dependent packages of the client and server-side code by running the ```npm i``` command in both folders inside the Command Prompt.
* After installing the dependencies start the client-side server and server-side server with the ```npm start``` command in both folders like in the previous step in the Command Prompt.
